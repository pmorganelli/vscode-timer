Presented at JumboHack 2025 under the <Education> track.

<Two to three sentences describing your project. It is a super cool project that
does some fun things.>

<Are you a Tufts CS student? Are you sick and tired of keeping track of how long you spend on
CS40, CS15, or any other programming courses? Meet CodeClock, a smart and seamless way to keep track
of your time spent, and a fun way to compare your time programming with your friends. Using our VSCode Extension, you can effortlessly start a timer when you begin a project and stop the timer when you put in a submission. We take care of the rest for you. After inputting an email, your data gets sent to our database
where we neatly organize a leaderboard with all your statistics. >

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<External libraries, other hackers/teams, generative AI models (i.e. ChatGPT),
online resources, etc.>

-ChatGPT was used throughout the process for questions, generating starter code, and debugging.
-VSCode documentation was used for API calls and using functions 
-StackOverflow for answering general code questions

REFLECTION
<What motivated your team to choose this project?>
-We had a lot of different ideas for our project, but we thought this one was
the most feasible given the timeframe and wanted to make a product that would
benefit the Tufts CS community. We also thought that this would allow us to learn
different technologies and tackle new problems, along with making a VSCode extension,
which has been on the bucket list for a long time.

<Potential future work/improvements?>
-There may be some edge cases we aren't aware of, and since the CodeClock timer
is intended for long-term use, more testing would be necessary before adding it to the
VSCode extension store.

<What is a challenge you encountered while making this?>
-One of the biggest challenges was building the backend and having all the data
we wanted in the same place. It was also a challenge to work in a group of 6, since
everyone was working on a different aspect of the project and we wanted to efficiently
combine our work. Using Git was very helpful for this, and we always stayed on the main
branch to try to speed up this process even more.

<What is a fun or interesting experience you had with another hacker?> 
-It was fun to work in a friend group and work on the process as much as we could.
We also learned a lot about prompting AI models, their effectiveness, and how to work
as a team to make an MVP (minimum viable product). We enjoyed this process throughout the
weekend and with more time we could have developed it even more and improve the
user experience.
